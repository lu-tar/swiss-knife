git clone https://github.com/lu-tar/swiss-knife.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory, create a virtual environment and activate it
```
cd swiss-knife
python -m venv venv
```
On Windows
```
venv\Scripts\activate

source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the required packages using the requirements.txt file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è
Swiss Knife operates like any other shell-like application, where commands require both mandatory and optional arguments. You can execute various functions by entering the appropriate commands.

```
ping 8.8.8.8
[-h, --help]       [-spw, --spawn]
[-r, --repeat]     [-t, --loop]
```

-h or --help list all the commands available

```
# tcpRTT wikipedia.org
[-h, --help]       [-r, --repeat]     [-t, --timeout]
[-p, --port]       [-s, --strict]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p, --port [PORT]     Destination port
  -r, --repeat [REPEAT]
                        How many time measure_latency runs
  -t, --timeout [TIMEOUT]
                        Measure_latency timeout
  -s, --strict          Strict output
```
